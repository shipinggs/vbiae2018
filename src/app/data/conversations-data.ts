                speech: [
                    ['Arvind', 'We have been living in this house for five years now, and I have to say, this place is just right for us. As a small family of three, we live in the main compound of the house. Our guests, when we have them, can stay at the rear part of the house. The wonderful part is the small communal space in between the two parts of the house, where we can sit around, have coffee, and meet our friends. We also love the high ceiling of this house – it just gives so much breathing space.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'This house has a long and narrow space, so my then client wanted it to look and feel spacious as much as possible. The original configuration was very different - the shophouse used to stop half-way here. But since the client also bought over the rear property, we had the opportunity to create another courtyard. This was how this garden space came about, and we created this big communal space which houses the kitchen and dining area. For the rear extension, we set off from the boundary, such that you can have immediate access to the greenery and outdoor space, when you are in any of the cubicles. You are sheltered, but at the same time you feel like being outdoors. One of the other challenges was to retain a sense of history, heritage and tradition and yet, be compatible with contemporary living. This process was pretty interesting, because we had relatively more time to ponder, as the construction went on. While we were trying to improve the wall, we realised that its plastering has to be removed in order to create a new one. But the old brick walls were so charming, so why not just expose all the brick walls? We also learnt that this shophouse had gone through a series of renovations. Our curiosity was piqued and we had the ambition then to trace back to the very origin of this shophouse and we found that it used to be a tiny bookshop selling cassette tapes and magazines. As the building is 100 years old, we peeled off layers of paint at the front façade to reveal the original colour. To our surprise, there were actually only a few shades of colours, which look almost like a watercolour rendering. We also kept the old signage, because the neighbours here, as well as my client, used to patronise this bookshop in their childhood. On the second storey, we intentionally kept those cavities, so that it gives one a hint of what this space used to be – a storage space for the bookstore. We also kept some of the old boundary walls untouched, which provided hints of where the old boundary line used to be.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'The use of wood everywhere also adds to the whole texture; it creates the warmth.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, and children feel particularly comfortable with wood. It is a very sensorial material.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'So, how long did the construction period take?'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'More than a year, around 15 months. There was a series of changes, as the client was deciding whether to come back to live in this house or to leave this house for his in-laws. In the end, he decided that this should be made as flexible as possible.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Changeability is what we also admire. When you open the door, you can experience how long the house is. And when you close the door, you simply forget how big the house can be. It is very unique how you use this land. Others would probably build something that is not so open, because of the way this site has been tucked in.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'We felt strongly about keeping this central space as open as possible, so that the neighbours on both sides of the house also have a view of this greenery. This is a shared backdrop for everybody in this area.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'It is especially pleasant in the evening. When we sit over here, the two fans are more than enough because of the high ceiling. And since it rains a lot here in Singapore, it’s nice to just sit and admire the rain outside... it’s like wow!']

                    ['Arvind', 'We moved in here before our child, Kabir, was born. But we did not struggle with his growing up. It is so natural and easy for him to navigate in this house because of the way that the passageway is designed to be all around. When we are not going out, Kabir would simply cycle around, along the passageway in a big loop. This is just perfect for him.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, I remember my young daughter was also running about in this house, and we did not have to worry about her. It is all very safe.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'It’s all very safe. We have seen other shophouses with different levels, and some even lacking in light and ventilation. I really like these high doors, which allow light to come into the space.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, the client wanted something, that is so open and classic such that whoever takes over can easily adapt to this environment. He is a very communal person, and naturally, he wanted this place to promote communal living as well.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Well, that is what we love about this house. The living room is large and you can just get together easily. You can also just sit around the kitchen. There was once when we threw a party for about 100 to 110 people in the garden space, and still, we did not feel that there were too many people in this tight space. People just spread naturally to the rear of this house and moved around nicely. Yet, we still had our privacy because nobody went upstairs or went too far behind.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Have you ever wondered why there isn’t a connecting sheltered pathway to the rear extension?'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Actually, we thought it would not make sense initially. My mother came and asked, “If it rains, how do you go?” We take umbrellas. There is just so much fun!'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, that was exactly the intention! We are so protected and sheltered most of the time. We live in a tropical country, but do not enjoy the rain.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'We enjoy that. We keep our umbrellas on both sides. Kabir loves that. He always wants to go to the other side holding an umbrella. And we thought that aesthetically this is rather nice, this minimalist style of living. Being an Indian and coming from an Indian family, this house requires us to have a bit of a mindshift towards living minimally. For example, traditionally, our kitchens are always closed and as an enclave, thus it was a mindshift for us to learn how to use an open kitchen here.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'I see.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'We cook a lot. And when my mother comes, she cooks really a lot, and Indian cooking is a little messy. There are a lot of curries, the smells and everything else. But now that we have become used to the open kitchen concept and keep it clean all the time, we really enjoy this space. With such a big slab counter in the kitchen, we feel like we are not too far away from food!'],

                speech: [
                    ['Arvind', 'When we lived in a condominium a long time ago, we thought that is how we would live our life. We never thought that space can actually kind of give energy back. Once we moved into this house, we realised that a house can actually give energy back. Sometimes when I come back after work, I walk in the house, look at the entire aesthetic of the house, and I feel rejuvenated. I feel humble and great at the same time. I think it has a lot to do with the material you use, it blending with the earth, the natural things. It’s all very raw, but yet very quirky.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'I’m really glad to hear that. That was the real intention behind the design – to create the kind of energy that money can’t buy. The design has achieved its goal, if it resonates well with the users. It’s also about how a place could bring people together to connect with each other and with the environment better. I believe that the materials themselves have energy. That’s why I’m more inclined to use raw materials, because I feel that they are still alive, and they are creating the energy that resonates with the user, as compared to using processed materials.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Yes, that’s what we like. We could get a house with very shiny marble and granite, but we feel that it might not connect. Here, we walk barefoot in the house, and we can feel the energy flowing back to us. In terms of housing in Singapore, most developers just want to maximise space. They want to make use of every square inch to give extra room and extra space, build a pool, build a tennis court, build everything. But I think they forget about the bonding between people. People also need brighter light and more sunlight. We have seen some big houses, where the land on which the houses were built on, was cut into two. It feels like you’re just living separately from each other rather than with each other. But with this house, it doesn’t feel that way.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, I really hope one day we can define property not in terms of per square foot but in terms of per volume, and in terms of other measures that are not so tangible, but which can really uplift a person’s life. This is my aspiration.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Agree. I think there are some things you just can’t put a value on. And space is that something that needs to be thought through differently.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'For architects, feeling is a very important aspect of design. If you activate your heart and design not just based on square feet, the end result will be very different.'],

                    ['Yung Ming', 'There are family and friends, and even neighbours, who think I am a bit mad, because typically people will buy a place and build four or five storeys to maximise the floor area. They think that I am crazy for keeping the floor area small, and for having so many planting areas. Some even say I am living under an overhead bridge! But this place is like alittle experiment to me. It started with a simple design brief I gave Ling Hao eight years ago: to house three guys – my father, my brother and I. Basically, I asked for three separate spaces for three guys and some areas for planting. The brief was to keep it simple and easy to maintain, nothing too complicated.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'Given the slim budget, we try to keep the things here rather slim – we kept whatever we could. So, that wall is an old wall, on top of which we built the new wall after inserting a steel structure. The slab is only 150mm thick, but within that there is a steel beam of 125mm, the slimmest possible in Singapore, so that the new additions were in harmony with the old structure. The built-up area of the house is about 1,500 square feet (or 140 square metres) which is about the size of an apartment, but there is a richness to the house despite its size. Because certain parts of the house have more than one function, like the kitchen is a pathway as well as the entrance. These ‘paths’ add to the richness of the house. To experience this house is to be in the different parts of the house, to walk the house, to feel it. I think this is how houses can be more. Our present experience is often shaped by our experiences, when we were young. I spent my youth living in a very open kind of space. So, even when it\'s a room, there is this idea of open living. I think it has become a kind of ambition I have now, when I am creating spaces.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'As our family grew from three to six people, we could still manage. This house is very open, so for privacy, we needed to learn how to share common spaces and communicate better. Although we have our respective rooms in the house, the central space is where we meet. Sometimes, everyone fights for the TV in the middle, so we have to compromise - by having TVs in our own rooms. Sometimes, when we come back late, we have to remind ourselves not to make too much noise. So, there is both good and bad to living in our shared space. You can shout across the room to send a message, but the downside is once everyone starts shouting, no one would be able to sleep. There is some fun to it, when you embrace that openness.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'In these parts, where it is hot and humid, you will certainly sweat a bit. To live in this climate, I think, also means that you have to feel something for sweating. You will have a kind of glow from sweating and you will look so much better. You also have to wear certain clothes that are more comfortable for this weather. Many parts of this house are naturally ventilated. Besides the walls, the rest of the surfaces are openings, which are quite large. For example, there are no walls above the entrance, just metal grille. The back of the house, near the kitchen, can also be completely open. So, you can feel it when there is a breeze, like right now. And that I think is nice because besides the experience of the house, you will have the memory of the wind. So, the openness is what allows this to happen.'],

                    ['Ling Hao', 'When you walk into this living room cum dining room space, it feels like you have walked into a garden. This is because we have kept the finishes the same for the whole house, whether it is inside or outside. For example, the doors are all metal doors, whether inside or outside. You can just move around and through the house seamlessly. The space is a double volume space and when the light streams in from the two skylights at the side, the space is almost as airy and bright as the outside. Then, you hear the birds chirping, you see the plants growing at the side, and you feel like you are still outside.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'What I have learnt from this place is how the indoor and outdoor experience can blend together. You can live in an open space, inside, yet you can experience some of the outdoor kind of sounds and experience. So it is kind of unique. Most people who visit this place can sense the blurring between the indoors and outdoors. It is quite obvious if you are in this space. Because of that, the spaces in this house are very dynamic. At different times of the day, you can have different favourite spots in the house. My family members have their own favourite spots. My wife loves sitting up on the roof to read, in the late evenings or early mornings. In the morning, it is also nice to be in this central space, because the light comes in and you can hear the birds. It is a nice place for breakfast, or just to see the light come up from above. Sometimes, when a cloud passes, the space becomes darker suddenly and you are struck by an awareness of your surroundings. The skylight can even be opened to allow the rain in, but that is not encouraged. In the evening, it is nice to be up on the roof, maybe around past 6.30 or 7pm, when it is cooler. You can gaze at the trees behind, look towards the forest of the nature reserve or watch a really beautiful sunset.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'For me, I am always interested in how this house is lived in. The making of the house is a process, but the story is part of a bigger thing. It is part of someone’s life, part of the overall work or something. What is also nice is how the house is transformed, to become this garden or this place where we live, and where nature becomes part of the house, part of the everyday.']

                    ['Ling Hao', 'We made different kinds of garden in this house. As you walk through the front gate, there is a garden. And as you come into this space, which is the heart of the house where the whole family can come together, there is another garden. As you go to the back of the house, where you can find the other bedroom, there are more spaces for planting too. Finally, as you go up to the roof, it is also a bigger space where you can work on planting. I think what is special is the way that Yung Ming embraced this idea of planting. He has been planting in the house. And to plant means to let things grow and to live with the growing, so you realise that you are not living in a fixed world.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'If you love plants they are like your friend, so you look after your friend. Every day you talk to it, you look at it. If something is wrong, you try to heal it. If the hair is too long, you have to trim it. Contrary to popular belief, I think that plants are easier to maintain. You can buy expensive things like painting and sculptures, but it is actually easier to maintain something simpler and less shiny. Plants also give a different life compared to hard, expensive sculptures, which are beautiful of course, but growing your own little things and watching them grow, there is something magical about it. It is about evolving with time. That’s why this house has different phases over the years. If you look at its old photos over time, it has continuously evolved and changed. It has been a very fulfilling experience to live here. I think our place in nature should be next to plants.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'As Yung Ming planted in this house, he also changed the way that he planted. It became wilder; it became a really thriving relationship. It is not so controlled, which to me, is something special. Our climate offers a beautiful, shady environment that is cool. It is actually what we build that makes the environment harsh. The city is harsh because of our ambitions versus the possible conditions of this climate. I am interested in the possibility of what can happen, if we step back a bit.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'If you have that kind of formal planting, where you want to control that look all the time, it becomes hard to maintain. You need a lot of pruning, fertilising, and controlling of the elements. But if you relax, let the plants grow, keep the weeds that are strong and beautiful and maybe let the plants that you originally select, which are not very strong and hard to maintain, die... basically, let nature take over and you will have a kind of balance which I find is better. But not everyone can accept such things like weeds and wild trees. A lot of people are scared that they cannot control nature, or rather, they just want to control nature. You can see it from the way they live, the way they build their house, and the way their garden is. You can see how much control they want, how much they are afraid of letting go. It is hard for them to let nature be and accept that nature will do some things that you cannot control so well.    '],

This multi-generational living concept was thus the key in our proposal for this public housing project.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, if you look at the bigger picture, Dawson is one of the older estates in Singapore. Therefore, family and community were the main design impetus in this project driving our inputs and design concepts. This project is one of the few, where we have given the architect leeway in expressing how the programming will be realised. We wanted to see how we can reinvent public housing in a new, modern way, that is centred around the community and the people.'],
                    ['Sod', 'That’s right, the real challenge for us was to see how multi-generational housing can be designed. What makes this different from other projects is that this entails taking social and political agendas, and turning them into architecture. For me, the process began by thinking of housing as individual modules and then turning that into a flexible entity to combine elderly studio units with the other duplexes. With the modular system in mind, we were able to express the programme in the way that was reflected in the built form.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'The final execution was very successful in expressing that. We can see the interlocking of the studio apartments and the larger flats clearly in the façade. The three- room, four-room and five-room flats form an interlink between the smaller and larger units.'],
                    ['Sod', 'The façade was designed by pairing the L-shaped duplex with an elderly studio unit, which functions as an autonomous unit. There’s an interconnecting link at the top of the stairway with two doors facing each other and serving as a connecting route. When both residents want to interact, they may leave their doors open. When they don’t, the doors remain closed.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, I think we have taken this successful concept of multi-generational living spaces and implemented it on a much wider scale. HDB’s Multi-Generation Priority Scheme allows elderly parents as well as young couples to apply for flats together. Some of these families like to live close to one another, while some may say, “No, I don’t want to live too close to my parents, but maybe on a different floor.” Suddenly, architecture becomes the medium to provide people with a lot more choices on how they can pair their living spaces together.'],

                    ['Sod', 'The other idea we had while designing this project was to see how we can integrate greenery with housing. The first step was to see how we can re-interpret the centralised car park space. The car park space was designed as a long linear block, with the natural landscape tiered down to form the façade. This acts as a hillock, in other words, a small hill which acts as an effective buffer space between the thresholds of the outside and the inside, the private and the public. A roof garden sits on the top of the car park space, functioning as a communal area that ties all the tower blocks together.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, this again reiterates our intent to build a project for the community, a public housing in the park. HDB’s mission is not just about building housing – we are equally interested in creating a whole environment for the residents and community of all generations, including the old, the young, and even non- residents within the locale. In Singapore, greenery has become a very important part of the living space. The unit itself is not just the only space that people enjoy. Instead of having a fenced-up development, this is about providing spaces of various attributes – small and intimate ones to larger public open spaces - for these diverse groups to enjoy. That is the true reflection of an effective public housing design!'],
                    ['Sod', 'When we first visited the site, we realised that the former canal was a big part of the context, so the idea was to allow this park to continue seamlessly over the car park and down on the other side. In essence, we are bringing the park up to the fourth level and then further up the sky terrace. The idea of housing in the park is really to push through not just horizontally, but also vertically, thereby introducing many layers of green.'],

Modularity and public housing were well studied by Le Corbusierin the Unite d\'Habitation – the idea of the plasticity of space and the compilation of all amenities into one single block. What we have done in this project was to take this idea, rotate, express it in the longitudinal section and tease it apart for ventilation. We have therefore taken the idea of the precedent and adapted it to our tropical climate. Sustainability was also a key design component in this project– the introduction of drip irrigation, solar panels to power the lighting in the common areas, bioswales and rainwater harvesting. As architects, we not only have a responsibility to the community, but also to the environment. This project is beyond housing and is ground-breaking on many levels, as there is an overarching social agenda in our every decision.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, many ideas including creating biodiversity in the area were explored. If the Old Margaret Drive is expunged, it will become an ecological corridor eventually. Mature trees in the area can then be preserved to be used to reinforce existing foliage. We don’t want public housing to have too many manicured spaces that require high maintenance.'],
                    ['Sod', 'Yes, that is why you will find that this project does not comprise a very calculated landscape with plenty of flowers. Rather, it incorporates an organic growth of greenery from around the area and into our project. The sky terraces are staggered to stitch the towers together, pockets of lightwells are introduced, and trees are grown in between the building and the car park. These have certainly helped to bring out the natural ambience of the space.'],

Enabling Village is the manifestation of how we see that support. We organise many different activities and events that are focused on both people with disabilities and those without, such as art festivals, story-telling events, music events, and cooking. Through these activities, people can come together and interact. We believe that is how we can build an inclusive society. When we first conceptualised the space, we were looking for an architect partner to come and work with us to create an inclusive and universally designed space. Beyond that, we wanted an architect who is able to work with us to fine-tune the vision and to really bring it to life.'],
                    ['HONG WEI', 'Well, I think it was a joy for us to work with SG Enable to bring this project from start to completion. I think it is very much about social sustainability, which is something our practice have always looked at in our projects. When this project came along, it was actually a perfect opportunity for us to see how the existing premises can be re-imagined to become a village that contributes to the society, so that it’s not just for people with disability, but also for everyone.'],
                    ['HERK', 'This space used to be a training centre a long time ago. When we first took over this space, we envisioned it as a continuation of its history of training and employment. At the same time, we want to work with persons with disabilities to give them value and a larger purpose in life, beyond just finding jobs or going for some training.'],
                    ['HONG WEI', 'The design brief that was given to us was to create a dedicated village that helps and supports people with disabilities. But, for us, the bigger thinking was how to create a space, not just specifically for people with disabilities, but for all with every ability. It is really about creating a common platform, a common ground, for people with diverse abilities, people of all ages, to be able to come together to make use of the space. That was, for us, very important, as we considered that to be very much aligned with SG Enable’s vision. As a spatial strategy, we tried to link up the common spaces with the other programmes developed by SG Enable alongside these spaces, and see how they can work together.'],
                    ['HERK', 'Before we envisioned what the Enabling Village was about, we organised some feedback sessions and design thinking sessions together with residents in the neighbourhood. We also had staff stationed at MRT stations and food centres to ask the residents in this area what they would like to see in this Enabling Village. There were a lot of feedback and inputs. For example, they wanted a garden, so we said, "Okay, we should make it a garden for the neighbourhood as well". We put those inputs into the design brief. After the village was launched, we noticed a lot of positive feedback from our clients, our users, and also the visitors. People who come by say that they feel a sense of peace: “It is very green”, “It is very natural”, “It is very calming” Many people asked, "Can I have an office here?". Or they joked about coming here for meetings and coffee. We take that as a good sign. The space itself is welcoming not only to its dedicated programme users, but also to people who come here for meetings or events or other activities.'],

                speech: [
                    ['HONG WEI', 'The key driver of the design was to incorporate nature into the village. So, we worked together with our client, our contractor, as well as our landscape consultant on how to curate the landscapes, so that the environment would be enriching to the occupants and the visitors. In the past, this space used to be a huge car park. We pushed the car park to the sides, and replaced the space with a big water garden, which is now a focal point to welcome visitors to the village. The nature of the landscape changes as you walk throughthe village: from a big water garden to the waterways. We created interesting crossings through the use of the existing linkway, as if it was spanning a water body. We also added many seats, so that they become resting points along the journey. Our landscape concept was to create different experiences as you walk through the site: there are areas where the landscape opens up and you can view the landscape in depth; there are also areas where the landscape come close to the passageways, and you can actually brush your hand against the shrubs. At the HUB, we brought the landscape up onto the pergola. We see a lot of people walking under the pergola, stretching their hand up intuitively to touch the aerial roots. And I think this is what landscaping can do – to engage the senses and bring everyone together to appreciate nature. Singapore is just one and half degree north of the equator, which means that we are blessed with lots of sunlight as well as rainfall. That is why we have selected a wide spectrum of native species here, as they tend to grow very well. In the end, we didn’t just create an aesthetic layering of landscape, but we also invited biodiversity into the site.'],

                speech: [
                    ['HERK', 'It is all about transforming the landscape into a public space. For example, our neighbours seem to like our garden at the back. Based on my observation, I can see that it is has led to more mingling between the residents living nearby and some of our clients here. I think this would remind people what it actually means to build an inclusive society.'],
                    ['HONG WEI', 'Additionally, part of the design concept was to create linkages through Enabling Village to the edges. By adding connections to the edges of the village, and by allowing people to walk through the village via these linkages, you can actually increase the opportunities for people to meet, to have interactions, to have better bonding and understanding. I think that helps to cultivate a village environment.'],
                    ['HERK', 'Absolutely. I really like this part, where the village is now part of the community, through the different gates and openings. In fact, we don\'t actually have fences. You see people coming in, sitting here, reading newspapers, enjoying the garden and the pond. The village has brought meaning and value to our neighbours as well.'],
                    ['HONG WEI', 'Another aspect was how to create interesting spaces. For example, this space here used to be a very steep slope. The garden previously was also neglected. So we overlaid a multipurpose amphitheatre on the slope and punched through the block to create an additional link to the neighbouring housing on the opposite side. Residents from there will then be able to walk through under the block, up the amphitheatre, and get to the other part of the village.'],
                    ['HERK', 'You can see many students walking from their school through here to their homes. The concept of a multi-purpose amphitheatre with a universally designed ramp is very useful.'],
                    ['HONG WEI', 'It was quite interesting for me, because just now, I saw a caregiver teaching a person in a wheelchair how to use the wheelchair to navigate the ramp. It is nice to see how the spaces are flexible and be adapted for different uses, and having more than one function.'],
                    ['HERK', 'This space has been something very fun for both us and the students. We actually had a movie night here with the screen over there. We invited our clients and their families to come and watch the movie. It was a very nice evening together. Every day, we see many clients and many of their caregivers coming to the village. The landscaping, the greenery, the ponds, the fish – all these really add to a calming and soothing effect. Many of the caregivers face considerable stress every day, and you can see their moods become significantly better when they come here. They will push or walk along the pathways” to “They will push wheelchairs or walk along the pathways together with their family members. You can see them taking their time to appreciate and interact with the greenery. And I think that is truly wonderful. WOHA has really done a wonderful job of converting this space into a lush paradise!'],

                    ['JERRY', 'The predecessor of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) - Alexandra Hospital – was an old colonial hospital consisting of a few three- to four-storey buildings and a huge landscape garden that occupied a third to a quarter of the site. Thus, the brief given for KTPH wasa “hospital in a garden” just like Alexandra Hospital, except that the scale was much larger. Therefore, at every available rooftop and along every corridor, we have inserted planter boxes and gardens to bring out this concept. One major challenge was our weather conditions. While we like the hospital to be very open and naturally ventilated, we must have weather protection, as there is glare and the wind would come in horizontally during thunderstorms. We brought back the use of jalousies because it can open fully, so on good days we can have fantastic ventilation when it is open. We also used grey tinted glass so that the light does not create glare for the patients, while providing ventilation.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'We tried our best to make this building more tropical. Instead of building shelters to cover the outdoor walking area, we actually used tall trees to provide shading. More than that, the trees also help to mitigate the urban heat island effect and reduce the ambient temperature around the hospital. The selected trees and plants have low tendency to shed leaves, are easy to maintain and do not need too much irrigation.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'I agree. The idea of planting trees to replace shelters is quite interesting. The brief actually asked for 50% of all the spaces to be naturally ventilated. We didn’t manage to achieve that due to the basic function of the hospital, as many spaces needed to be either mechanically ventilated or air conditioned, such as the operating theatres and the Intensive Care Units. That is why we freed up all the public spaces to be naturally ventilated spaces.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'After KTPH was opened for quite some time, and the trees grew taller and the greenery expanded, we had many unexpected animal visitors. We actually had to engage external help to remove them, because some of them are endangered species. While we managed to relocate some of them, we do expect more wildlife in future.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'Yes, in fact, when the biodiversity survey was done at the start of the project, we had only three species of butterflies. Now, we have over 85 species! This is a testament to the biodiversity. By designing the environment based on the concept of natural integration, we have achieved unexpected results.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'Another aspect was the use of the Yishun Pond next to the hospital. We managed to collaborate with the Public Utilities Board to draw water from the pond at a reduced cost – not for drinking purposes but for irrigating the plants. This helps greatly, as we do not have the space to build a large water tank to irrigate the plants and trees in the hospital.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'These could be the most unique aspects of our design – how we have integrated Yishun Pond as part of the hospital, although it does not belong to KTPH; how we have seamlessly integrated nature into the hospital; and how we have opened up the entire hospital and made it accessible to the public. I believe nature plays a very important role in creating a healing environment for everybody – patients, caregivers, staff or anybody who comes in.'],

We figured that one way to reduce the maintenance cost is to engage volunteers who are very passionate about landscaping and greenery. We managed to get residents who live around this area and in the northern region of Singapore to come and help with our gardening, pruning and fertilising of the soil. We even engaged our staff to do gardening, so that everyone feels that it is also his responsibility to maintain the greenery of this hospital.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'Well, it actually has become part of the community engagement! I think this is really the ethos behind how we look at every challenge – by turning it into something that is much more beneficial in the end.'],

                    ['JERRY', 'Yes, we worked closely with the hospital team and invited the visually impaired, hearing impaired or physically handicapped to join a session to give feedback on what they want to experience in a hospital. We listened and tried to incorporate some of their feedback into the design. We even moved around in wheelchairs on our own at the old Alexandra Hospital, to experience how it was like to negotiate a slope. I think all hospital planners must go through that exercise to understand that what they design would actually impact the users, so that they would never take anything for granted.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'We also engage the nearby residents in our rooftop farm. In fact, we manage to harvest enough vegetables and fruits to give to our patients once a week, and sell the excess to the community. We then use the funds collected to buy more fertilisers or anything that is needed to enhance the landscape and rooftop farm.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'I think the whole idea of how the compost is used as fertiliser to grow vegetables, and how all these vegetables end up on the plates of the patients is amazing. Can you imagine if we could activate all the rooftops in all our public housing as rooftop farms?'],

How can we create an environment where patients can heal faster, feel less stressed and more relaxed?'],

The patients also come up to our farm to look at the trees and fruits being planted. I think patients also appreciate the fact that we have worked together with other government agencies to create a “health promoting park” around Yishun Pond, where the one kilometre around the pond has been turned into a walking or jogging track. Our patients can take an evening stroll while enjoying the scenery of the calming water, the floating wetlands and the greenery around the pond. In a way, we have managed to motivate the patients to leave their beds and come out of the wards. By walking and doing exercises, patients actually begin to show signs that they are trying to return to normal life, that they are able to fully enjoy the environment, and they are looking forward to returning to their normal routine.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'It is about creating a positive distraction, when they are staying at a hospital. A healing environment is also equally important for staff. In a stressful workplace with a high burnout or turnover rate, it is important to create an environment that they want to work in, where they can feel relaxed.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'I have spoken to many of our staff and most of them appreciate the fact that there are many outdoor areas for them to have discussions, short meetings and even to take their lunch or dinner if they are working late. They feel that the calm and green environment actually helps to reduce their stress levels.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'It is interesting that in a post occupancy survey of staff, patients and visitors to the hospital, the results show that, besides being appreciative of the amount of green and water features, they are willing to pay more to have more of these facilities around the hospital!'],
                    ['DONALD', 'Even before the survey was done, we had already received many positive reviews from our patients and staff. The report from Dr. Nirmal Kishnani also verifies that we did create a healing environment for both patients and staff. We would like to create even more public spaces with landscapes and greeneries to let our patients enjoy, while ensuring its sustainability and affordability.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'So it shows that we are on the right track.

At that time, Kallang River was due for replacement and National Parks Board (NParks) was also seeking to redevelop the park.

Certainly, these did not happen by chance. In fact, we designed the spaces with the potential users in mind.

Once we moved into this house, we realised that a house can actually give energy back. Sometimes when I come back after work, I walk in the house, look at the entire aesthetic of the house, and I feel rejuvenated. I feel humble and great at the same time. I think it has a lot to do with the material you use, it blending with the earth, the natural things. It’s all very raw, but yet very quirky.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'I’m really glad to hear that. That was the real intention behind the design – to create the kind of energy that money can’t buy. The design has achieved its goal, if it resonates well with the users. It’s also about how a place could bring people together to connect with each other and with the environment better. I believe that the materials themselves have energy. That’s why I’m more inclined to use raw materials, because I feel that they are still alive, and they are creating the energy that resonates with the user, as compared to using processed materials.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Yes, that’s what we like. We could get a house with very shiny marble and granite, but we feel that it might not connect. Here, we walk barefoot in the house, and we can feel the energy flowing back to us. In terms of housing in Singapore, most developers just want to maximise space. They want to make use of every square inch to give extra room and extra space, build a pool, build a tennis court, build everything. But I think they forget about the bonding between people. People also need brighter light and more sunlight. We have seen some big houses, where the land on which the houses were built on, was cut into two. It feels like you’re just living separately from each other rather than with each other. But with this house, it doesn’t feel that way.'],

This was how this garden space came about, and we created this big communal space which houses the kitchen and dining area. For the rear extension, we set off from the boundary, such that you can have immediate access to the greenery and outdoor space, when you are in any of the cubicles. You are sheltered, but at the same time you feel like being outdoors. One of the other challenges was to retain a sense of history, heritage and tradition and yet, be compatible with contemporary living. This process was pretty interesting, because we had relatively more time to ponder, as the construction went on. While we were trying to improve the wall, we realised that its plastering has to be removed in order to create a new one. But the old brick walls were so charming, so why not just expose all the brick walls? We also learnt that this shophouse had gone through a series of renovations. Our curiosity was piqued and we had the ambition then to trace back to the very origin of this shophouse and we found that it used to be a tiny bookshop selling cassette tapes and magazines. As the building is 100 years old, we peeled off layers of paint at the front façade to reveal the original colour.

For the rear extension, we set off from the boundary, such that you can have immediate access to the greenery and outdoor space, when you are in any of the cubicles. You are sheltered, but at the same time you feel like being outdoors. One of the other challenges was to retain a sense of history, heritage and tradition and yet, be compatible with contemporary living. This process was pretty interesting, because we had relatively more time to ponder, as the construction went on. While we were trying to improve the wall, we realised that its plastering has to be removed in order to create a new one. But the old brick walls were so charming, so why not just expose all the brick walls? We also learnt that this shophouse had gone through a series of renovations. Our curiosity was piqued and we had the ambition then to trace back to the very origin of this shophouse and we found that it used to be a tiny bookshop selling cassette tapes and magazines. As the building is 100 years old, we peeled off layers of paint at the front façade to reveal the original colour. To our surprise, there were actually only a few shades of colours, which look almost like a watercolour rendering. We also kept the old signage, because the neighbours here, as well as my client, used to patronise this bookshop in their childhood. On the second storey, we intentionally kept those cavities, so that it gives one a hint of what this space used to be – a storage space for the bookstore. We also kept some of the old boundary walls untouched, which provided hints of where the old boundary line used to be.'],

                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, and children feel particularly comfortable with wood. It is a very sensorial material.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'So, how long did the construction period take?'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'More than a year, around 15 months. There was a series of changes, as the client was deciding whether to come back to live in this house or to leave this house for his in-laws. In the end, he decided that this should be made as flexible as possible.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Changeability is what we also admire. When you open the door, you can experience how long the house is. And when you close the door, you simply forget how big the house can be. It is very unique how you use this land. Others would probably build something that is not so open, because of the way this site has been tucked in.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'We felt strongly about keeping this central space as open as possible, so that the neighbours on both sides of the house also have a view of this greenery. This is a shared backdrop for everybody in this area.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'It is especially pleasant in the evening. When we sit over here, the two fans are more than enough because of the high ceiling. And since it rains a lot here in Singapore, it’s nice to just sit and admire the rain outside... it’s like wow!']

It is so natural and easy for him to navigate in this house because of the way that the passageway is designed to be all around. When we are not going out, Kabir would simply cycle around, along the passageway in a big loop. This is just perfect for him.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, I remember my young daughter was also running about in this house, and we did not have to worry about her. It is all very safe.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'It’s all very safe. We have seen other shophouses with different levels, and some even lacking in light and ventilation. I really like these high doors, which allow light to come into the space.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, the client wanted something, that is so open and classic such that whoever takes over can easily adapt to this environment. He is a very communal person, and naturally, he wanted this place to promote communal living as well.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Well, that is what we love about this house. The living room is large and you can just get together easily. You can also just sit around the kitchen. There was once when we threw a party for about 100 to 110 people in the garden space, and still, we did not feel that there were too many people in this tight space. People just spread naturally to the rear of this house and moved around nicely. Yet, we still had our privacy because nobody went upstairs or went too far behind.'],

                    ['Arvind', 'Actually, we thought it would not make sense initially. My mother came and asked, “If it rains, how do you go?” We take umbrellas. There is just so much fun!'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, that was exactly the intention! We are so protected and sheltered most of the time. We live in a tropical country, but do not enjoy the rain.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'We enjoy that. We keep our umbrellas on both sides. Kabir loves that. He always wants to go to the other side holding an umbrella. And we thought that aesthetically this is rather nice, this minimalist style of living. Being an Indian and coming from an Indian family, this house requires us to have a bit of a mindshift towards living minimally. For example, traditionally, our kitchens are always closed and as an enclave, thus it was a mindshift for us to learn how to use an open kitchen here.'],

But now that we have become used to the open kitchen concept and keep it clean all the time, we really enjoy this space. With such a big slab counter in the kitchen, we feel like we are not too far away from food!'],

                    ['Arvind', 'When we lived in a condominium a long time ago, we thought that is how we would live our life. We never thought that space can actually kind of give energy back. Once we moved into this house, we realised that a house can actually give energy back. Sometimes when I come back after work, I walk in the house, look at the entire aesthetic of the house, and I feel rejuvenated. I feel humble and great at the same time. I think it has a lot to do with the material you use, it blending with the earth, the natural things. It’s all very raw, but yet very quirky.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'I’m really glad to hear that. That was the real intention behind the design – to create the kind of energy that money can’t buy. The design has achieved its goal, if it resonates well with the users. It’s also about how a place could bring people together to connect with each other and with the environment better. I believe that the materials themselves have energy. That’s why I’m more inclined to use raw materials, because I feel that they are still alive, and they are creating the energy that resonates with the user, as compared to using processed materials.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Yes, that’s what we like. We could get a house with very shiny marble and granite, but we feel that it might not connect. Here, we walk barefoot in the house, and we can feel the energy flowing back to us. In terms of housing in Singapore, most developers just want to maximise space. They want to make use of every square inch to give extra room and extra space, build a pool, build a tennis court, build everything. But I think they forget about the bonding between people. People also need brighter light and more sunlight. We have seen some big houses, where the land on which the houses were built on, was cut into two. It feels like you’re just living separately from each other rather than with each other. But with this house, it doesn’t feel that way.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, I really hope one day we can define property not in terms of per square foot but in terms of per volume, and in terms of other measures that are not so tangible, but which can really uplift a person’s life. This is my aspiration.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Agree. I think there are some things you just can’t put a value on. And space is that something that needs to be thought through differently.'],
