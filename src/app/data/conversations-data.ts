                    ['Arvind', 'We have been living in this house for five years now, and I have to say, this place is just right for us. As a small family of three, we live in the main compound of the house. Our guests, when we have them, can stay at the rear part of the house. The wonderful part is the small communal space in between the two parts of the house, where we can sit around, have coffee, and meet our friends. We also love the high ceiling of this house – it just gives so much breathing space.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'This house has a long and narrow space, so my then client wanted it to look and feel spacious as much as possible. The original configuration was very different - the shophouse used to stop half-way here. But since the client also bought over the rear property, we had the opportunity to create another courtyard. This was how this garden space came about, and we created this big communal space which houses the kitchen and dining area. For the rear extension, we set off from the boundary, such that you can have immediate access to the greenery and outdoor space, when you are in any of the cubicles. You are sheltered, but at the same time you feel like being outdoors. One of the other challenges was to retain a sense of history, heritage and tradition and yet, be compatible with contemporary living. This process was pretty interesting, because we had relatively more time to ponder, as the construction went on. While we were trying to improve the wall, we realised that its plastering has to be removed in order to create a new one. But the old brick walls were so charming, so why not just expose all the brick walls? We also learnt that this shophouse had gone through a series of renovations. Our curiosity was piqued and we had the ambition then to trace back to the very origin of this shophouse and we found that it used to be a tiny bookshop selling cassette tapes and magazines. As the building is 100 years old, we peeled off layers of paint at the front façade to reveal the original colour. To our surprise, there were actually only a few shades of colours, which look almost like a watercolour rendering. We also kept the old signage, because the neighbours here, as well as my client, used to patronise this bookshop in their childhood. On the second storey, we intentionally kept those cavities, so that it gives one a hint of what this space used to be – a storage space for the bookstore. We also kept some of the old boundary walls untouched, which provided hints of where the old boundary line used to be.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'The use of wood everywhere also adds to the whole texture; it creates the warmth.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, and children feel particularly comfortable with wood. It is a very sensorial material.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'So, how long did the construction period take?'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'More than a year, around 15 months. There was a series of changes, as the client was deciding whether to come back to live in this house or to leave this house for his in-laws. In the end, he decided that this should be made as flexible as possible.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Changeability is what we also admire. When you open the door, you can experience how long the house is. And when you close the door, you simply forget how big the house can be. It is very unique how you use this land. Others would probably build something that is not so open, because of the way this site has been tucked in.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'We felt strongly about keeping this central space as open as possible, so that the neighbours on both sides of the house also have a view of this greenery. This is a shared backdrop for everybody in this area.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'It is especially pleasant in the evening. When we sit over here, the two fans are more than enough because of the high ceiling. And since it rains a lot here in Singapore, it’s nice to just sit and admire the rain outside... it’s like wow!']

It is so natural and easy for him to navigate in this house because of the way that the passageway is designed to be all around. When we are not going out, Kabir would simply cycle around, along the passageway in a big loop. This is just perfect for him.'],

                    ['Arvind', 'It’s all very safe. We have seen other shophouses with different levels, and some even lacking in light and ventilation. I really like these high doors, which allow light to come into the space.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, the client wanted something, that is so open and classic such that whoever takes over can easily adapt to this environment. He is a very communal person, and naturally, he wanted this place to promote communal living as well.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Well, that is what we love about this house. The living room is large and you can just get together easily. You can also just sit around the kitchen. There was once when we threw a party for about 100 to 110 people in the garden space, and still, we did not feel that there were too many people in this tight space. People just spread naturally to the rear of this house and moved around nicely. Yet, we still had our privacy because nobody went upstairs or went too far behind.'],

                    ['Arvind', 'We enjoy that. We keep our umbrellas on both sides. Kabir loves that. He always wants to go to the other side holding an umbrella. And we thought that aesthetically this is rather nice, this minimalist style of living. Being an Indian and coming from an Indian family, this house requires us to have a bit of a mindshift towards living minimally. For example, traditionally, our kitchens are always closed and as an enclave, thus it was a mindshift for us to learn how to use an open kitchen here.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'I see.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'We cook a lot. And when my mother comes, she cooks really a lot, and Indian cooking is a little messy. There are a lot of curries, the smells and everything else. But now that we have become used to the open kitchen concept and keep it clean all the time, we really enjoy this space. With such a big slab counter in the kitchen, we feel like we are not too far away from food!'],

                speech: [
                    ['Arvind', 'When we lived in a condominium a long time ago, we thought that is how we would live our life. We never thought that space can actually kind of give energy back. Once we moved into this house, we realised that a house can actually give energy back. Sometimes when I come back after work, I walk in the house, look at the entire aesthetic of the house, and I feel rejuvenated. I feel humble and great at the same time. I think it has a lot to do with the material you use, it blending with the earth, the natural things. It’s all very raw, but yet very quirky.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'I’m really glad to hear that. That was the real intention behind the design – to create the kind of energy that money can’t buy. The design has achieved its goal, if it resonates well with the users. It’s also about how a place could bring people together to connect with each other and with the environment better. I believe that the materials themselves have energy. That’s why I’m more inclined to use raw materials, because I feel that they are still alive, and they are creating the energy that resonates with the user, as compared to using processed materials.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Yes, that’s what we like. We could get a house with very shiny marble and granite, but we feel that it might not connect. Here, we walk barefoot in the house, and we can feel the energy flowing back to us. In terms of housing in Singapore, most developers just want to maximise space. They want to make use of every square inch to give extra room and extra space, build a pool, build a tennis court, build everything. But I think they forget about the bonding between people. People also need brighter light and more sunlight. We have seen some big houses, where the land on which the houses were built on, was cut into two. It feels like you’re just living separately from each other rather than with each other. But with this house, it doesn’t feel that way.'],
                    ['Yong Ter', 'Yes, I really hope one day we can define property not in terms of per square foot but in terms of per volume, and in terms of other measures that are not so tangible, but which can really uplift a person’s life. This is my aspiration.'],
                    ['Arvind', 'Agree. I think there are some things you just can’t put a value on. And space is that something that needs to be thought through differently.'],

                    ['Yung Ming', 'There are family and friends, and even neighbours, who think I am a bit mad, because typically people will buy a place and build four or five storeys to maximise the floor area. They think that I am crazy for keeping the floor area small, and for having so many planting areas. Some even say I am living under an overhead bridge! But this place is like alittle experiment to me. It started with a simple design brief I gave Ling Hao eight years ago: to house three guys – my father, my brother and I. Basically, I asked for three separate spaces for three guys and some areas for planting. The brief was to keep it simple and easy to maintain, nothing too complicated.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'Given the slim budget, we try to keep the things here rather slim – we kept whatever we could. So, that wall is an old wall, on top of which we built the new wall after inserting a steel structure. The slab is only 150mm thick, but within that there is a steel beam of 125mm, the slimmest possible in Singapore, so that the new additions were in harmony with the old structure. The built-up area of the house is about 1,500 square feet (or 140 square metres) which is about the size of an apartment, but there is a richness to the house despite its size. Because certain parts of the house have more than one function, like the kitchen is a pathway as well as the entrance. These ‘paths’ add to the richness of the house. To experience this house is to be in the different parts of the house, to walk the house, to feel it. I think this is how houses can be more. Our present experience is often shaped by our experiences, when we were young. I spent my youth living in a very open kind of space. So, even when it\'s a room, there is this idea of open living. I think it has become a kind of ambition I have now, when I am creating spaces.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'As our family grew from three to six people, we could still manage. This house is very open, so for privacy, we needed to learn how to share common spaces and communicate better. Although we have our respective rooms in the house, the central space is where we meet. Sometimes, everyone fights for the TV in the middle, so we have to compromise - by having TVs in our own rooms. Sometimes, when we come back late, we have to remind ourselves not to make too much noise. So, there is both good and bad to living in our shared space. You can shout across the room to send a message, but the downside is once everyone starts shouting, no one would be able to sleep. There is some fun to it, when you embrace that openness.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'In these parts, where it is hot and humid, you will certainly sweat a bit. To live in this climate, I think, also means that you have to feel something for sweating. You will have a kind of glow from sweating and you will look so much better. You also have to wear certain clothes that are more comfortable for this weather. Many parts of this house are naturally ventilated. Besides the walls, the rest of the surfaces are openings, which are quite large. For example, there are no walls above the entrance, just metal grille. The back of the house, near the kitchen, can also be completely open. So, you can feel it when there is a breeze, like right now. And that I think is nice because besides the experience of the house, you will have the memory of the wind. So, the openness is what allows this to happen.'],

                    ['Ling Hao', 'When you walk into this living room cum dining room space, it feels like you have walked into a garden. This is because we have kept the finishes the same for the whole house, whether it is inside or outside. For example, the doors are all metal doors, whether inside or outside. You can just move around and through the house seamlessly. The space is a double volume space and when the light streams in from the two skylights at the side, the space is almost as airy and bright as the outside. Then, you hear the birds chirping, you see the plants growing at the side, and you feel like you are still outside.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'What I have learnt from this place is how the indoor and outdoor experience can blend together. You can live in an open space, inside, yet you can experience some of the outdoor kind of sounds and experience. So it is kind of unique. Most people who visit this place can sense the blurring between the indoors and outdoors. It is quite obvious if you are in this space. Because of that, the spaces in this house are very dynamic. At different times of the day, you can have different favourite spots in the house. My family members have their own favourite spots. My wife loves sitting up on the roof to read, in the late evenings or early mornings. In the morning, it is also nice to be in this central space, because the light comes in and you can hear the birds. It is a nice place for breakfast, or just to see the light come up from above. Sometimes, when a cloud passes, the space becomes darker suddenly and you are struck by an awareness of your surroundings. The skylight can even be opened to allow the rain in, but that is not encouraged. In the evening, it is nice to be up on the roof, maybe around past 6.30 or 7pm, when it is cooler. You can gaze at the trees behind, look towards the forest of the nature reserve or watch a really beautiful sunset.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'For me, I am always interested in how this house is lived in. The making of the house is a process, but the story is part of a bigger thing. It is part of someone’s life, part of the overall work or something. What is also nice is how the house is transformed, to become this garden or this place where we live, and where nature becomes part of the house, part of the everyday.']

                    ['Ling Hao', 'We made different kinds of garden in this house. As you walk through the front gate, there is a garden. And as you come into this space, which is the heart of the house where the whole family can come together, there is another garden. As you go to the back of the house, where you can find the other bedroom, there are more spaces for planting too. Finally, as you go up to the roof, it is also a bigger space where you can work on planting. I think what is special is the way that Yung Ming embraced this idea of planting. He has been planting in the house. And to plant means to let things grow and to live with the growing, so you realise that you are not living in a fixed world.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'If you love plants they are like your friend, so you look after your friend. Every day you talk to it, you look at it. If something is wrong, you try to heal it. If the hair is too long, you have to trim it. Contrary to popular belief, I think that plants are easier to maintain. You can buy expensive things like painting and sculptures, but it is actually easier to maintain something simpler and less shiny. Plants also give a different life compared to hard, expensive sculptures, which are beautiful of course, but growing your own little things and watching them grow, there is something magical about it. It is about evolving with time. That’s why this house has different phases over the years. If you look at its old photos over time, it has continuously evolved and changed. It has been a very fulfilling experience to live here. I think our place in nature should be next to plants.'],
                    ['Ling Hao', 'As Yung Ming planted in this house, he also changed the way that he planted. It became wilder; it became a really thriving relationship. It is not so controlled, which to me, is something special. Our climate offers a beautiful, shady environment that is cool. It is actually what we build that makes the environment harsh. The city is harsh because of our ambitions versus the possible conditions of this climate. I am interested in the possibility of what can happen, if we step back a bit.'],
                    ['Yung Ming', 'If you have that kind of formal planting, where you want to control that look all the time, it becomes hard to maintain. You need a lot of pruning, fertilising, and controlling of the elements. But if you relax, let the plants grow, keep the weeds that are strong and beautiful and maybe let the plants that you originally select, which are not very strong and hard to maintain, die... basically, let nature take over and you will have a kind of balance which I find is better. But not everyone can accept such things like weeds and wild trees. A lot of people are scared that they cannot control nature, or rather, they just want to control nature. You can see it from the way they live, the way they build their house, and the way their garden is. You can see how much control they want, how much they are afraid of letting go. It is hard for them to let nature be and accept that nature will do some things that you cannot control so well.    '],

This multi-generational living concept was thus the key in our proposal for this public housing project.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, if you look at the bigger picture, Dawson is one of the older estates in Singapore. Therefore, family and community were the main design impetus in this project driving our inputs and design concepts. This project is one of the few, where we have given the architect leeway in expressing how the programming will be realised. We wanted to see how we can reinvent public housing in a new, modern way, that is centred around the community and the people.'],
                    ['Soo', 'That’s right, the real challenge for us was to see how multi-generational housing can be designed. What makes this different from other projects is that this entails taking social and political agendas, and turning them into architecture. For me, the process began by thinking of housing as individual modules and then turning that into a flexible entity to combine elderly studio units with the other duplexes. With the modular system in mind, we were able to express the programme in the way that was reflected in the built form.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'The final execution was very successful in expressing that. We can see the interlocking of the studio apartments and the larger flats clearly in the façade. The three-room, four-room and five-room flats form an interlink between the smaller and larger units.'],
                    ['Soo', 'The façade was designed by pairing the L-shaped duplex with an elderly studio unit, which functions as an autonomous unit. There’s an interconnecting link at the top of the stairway with two doors facing each other and serving as a connecting route. When both residents want to interact, they may leave their doors open. When they don’t, the doors remain closed.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, I think we have taken this successful concept of multi-generational living spaces and implemented it on a much wider scale. HDB’s Multi-Generation Priority Scheme allows elderly parents as well as young couples to apply for flats together. Some of these families like to live close to one another, while some may say, “No, I don’t want to live too close to my parents, but maybe on a different floor.” Suddenly, architecture becomes the medium to provide people with a lot more choices on how they can pair their living spaces together.'],

                    ['Soo', 'The other idea we had while designing this project was to see how we can integrate greenery with housing. The first step was to see how we can re-interpret the centralised car park space. The car park space was designed as a long linear block, with the natural landscape tiered down to form the façade. This acts as a hillock, in other words, a small hill which acts as an effective buffer space between the thresholds of the outside and the inside, the private and the public. A roof garden sits on the top of the car park space, functioning as a communal area that ties all the tower blocks together.'],
                    ['Chun Wah', 'Yes, this again reiterates our intent to build a project for the community, a public housing in the park. HDB’s mission is not just about building housing – we are equally interested in creating a whole environment for the residents and community of all generations, including the old, the young, and even non- residents within the locale. In Singapore, greenery has become a very important part of the living space. The unit itself is not just the only space that people enjoy. Instead of having a fenced-up development, this is about providing spaces of various attributes – small and intimate ones to larger public open spaces - for these diverse groups to enjoy. That is the true reflection of an effective public housing design!'],
                    ['Soo', 'When we first visited the site, we realised that the former canal was a big part of the context, so the idea was to allow this park to continue seamlessly over the car park and down on the other side. In essence, we are bringing the park up to the fourth level and then further up the sky terrace. The idea of housing in the park is really to push through not just horizontally, but also vertically, thereby introducing many layers of green.'],

Modularity and public housing were well studied by Le Corbusierin the Unite d\'Habitation – the idea of the plasticity of space and the compilation of all amenities into one single block. What we have done in this project was to take this idea, rotate, express it in the longitudinal section and tease it apart for ventilation. We have therefore taken the idea of the precedent and adapted it to our tropical climate. Sustainability was also a key design component in this project– the introduction of drip irrigation, solar panels to power the lighting in the common areas, bioswales and rainwater harvesting. As architects, we not only have a responsibility to the community, but also to the environment. This project is beyond housing and is ground-breaking on many levels, as there is an overarching social agenda in our every decision.'],

Rather, it incorporates an organic growth of greenery from around the area and into our project. The sky terraces are staggered to stitch the towers together, pockets of lightwells are introduced, and trees are grown in between the building and the car park. These have certainly helped to bring out the natural ambience of the space.'],

Through these activities, people can come together and interact. We believe that is how we can build an inclusive society. When we first conceptualised the space, we were looking for an architect partner to come and work with us to create an inclusive and universally designed space.

It is really about creating a common platform, a common ground, for people with diverse abilities, people of all ages, to be able to come together to make use of the space. That was, for us, very important, as we considered that to be very much aligned with SG Enable’s vision. As a spatial strategy, we tried to link up the common spaces with the other programmes developed by SG Enable alongside these spaces, and see how they can work together.'],

We also had staff stationed at MRT stations and food centres to ask the residents in this area what they would like to see in this Enabling Village. There were a lot of feedback and inputs. For example, they wanted a garden, so we said, "Okay, we should make it a garden for the neighbourhood as well". We put those inputs into the design brief. After the village was launched, we noticed a lot of positive feedback from our clients, our users, and also the visitors. People who come by say that they feel a sense of peace: “It is very green”, “It is very natural”, “It is very calming” Many people asked, "Can I have an office here?". Or they joked about coming here for meetings and coffee. We take that as a good sign. The space itself is welcoming not only to its dedicated programme users, but also to people who come here for meetings or events or other activities.'],

So, we worked together with our client, our contractor, as well as our landscape consultant on how to curate the landscapes, so that the environment would be enriching to the occupants and the visitors. In the past, this space used to be a huge car park. We pushed the car park to the sides, and replaced the space with a big water garden, which is now a focal point to welcome visitors to the village. The nature of the landscape changes as you walk throughthe village: from a big water garden to the waterways. We created interesting crossings through the use of the existing linkway, as if it was spanning a water body. We also added many seats, so that they become resting points along the journey. Our landscape concept was to create different experiences as you walk through the site: there are areas where the landscape opens up and you can view the landscape in depth; there are also areas where the landscape come close to the passageways, and you can actually brush your hand against the shrubs. At the HUB, we brought the landscape up onto the pergola. We see a lot of people walking under the pergola, stretching their hand up intuitively to touch the aerial roots. And I think this is what landscaping can do – to engage the senses and bring everyone together to appreciate nature. Singapore is just one and half degree north of the equator, which means that we are blessed with lots of sunlight as well as rainfall. That is why we have selected a wide spectrum of native species here, as they tend to grow very well. In the end, we didn’t just create an aesthetic layering of landscape, but we also invited biodiversity into the site.'],

Based on my observation, I can see that it is has led to more mingling between the residents living nearby and some of our clients here. I think this would remind people what it actually means to build an inclusive society.'],
                    ['HONG WEI', 'Additionally, part of the design concept was to create linkages through Enabling Village to the edges. By adding connections to the edges of the village, and by allowing people to walk through the village via these linkages, you can actually increase the opportunities for people to meet, to have interactions, to have better bonding and understanding. I think that helps to cultivate a village environment.'],

                    ['HONG WEI', 'Another aspect was how to create interesting spaces. For example, this space here used to be a very steep slope. The garden previously was also neglected. So we overlaid a multipurpose amphitheatre on the slope and punched through the block to create an additional link to the neighbouring housing on the opposite side. Residents from there will then be able to walk through under the block, up the amphitheatre, and get to the other part of the village.'],

The landscaping, the greenery, the ponds, the fish – all these really add to a calming and soothing effect. Many of the caregivers face considerable stress every day, and you can see their moods become significantly better when they come here. They will push or walk along the pathways” to “They will push wheelchairs or walk along the pathways together with their family members.

Thus, the brief given for KTPH wasa “hospital in a garden” just like Alexandra Hospital, except that the scale was much larger. Therefore, at every available rooftop and along every corridor, we have inserted planter boxes and gardens to bring out this concept. One major challenge was our weather conditions. While we like the hospital to be very open and naturally ventilated, we must have weather protection, as there is glare and the wind would come in horizontally during thunderstorms. We brought back the use of jalousies because it can open fully, so on good days we can have fantastic ventilation when it is open. We also used grey tinted glass so that the light does not create glare for the patients, while providing ventilation.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'We tried our best to make this building more tropical. Instead of building shelters to cover the outdoor walking area, we actually used tall trees to provide shading. More than that, the trees also help to mitigate the urban heat island effect and reduce the ambient temperature around the hospital. The selected trees and plants have low tendency to shed leaves, are easy to maintain and do not need too much irrigation.'],
                    ['JERRY', 'I agree. The idea of planting trees to replace shelters is quite interesting. The brief actually asked for 50% of all the spaces to be naturally ventilated. We didn’t manage to achieve that due to the basic function of the hospital, as many spaces needed to be either mechanically ventilated or air conditioned, such as the operating theatres and the Intensive Care Units. That is why we freed up all the public spaces to be naturally ventilated spaces.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'After KTPH was opened for quite some time, and the trees grew taller and the greenery expanded, we had many unexpected animal visitors. We actually had to engage external help to remove them, because some of them are endangered species. While we managed to relocate some of them, we do expect more wildlife in future.'],

This is a testament to the biodiversity. By designing the environment based on the concept of natural integration, we have achieved unexpected results.'],
                    ['DONALD', 'Another aspect was the use of the Yishun Pond next to the hospital. We managed to collaborate with the Public Utilities Board to draw water from the pond at a reduced cost – not for drinking purposes but for irrigating the plants. This helps greatly, as we do not have the space to build a large water tank to irrigate the plants and trees in the hospital.'],

We managed to get residents who live around this area and in the northern region of Singapore to come and help with our gardening, pruning and fertilising of the soil. We even engaged our staff to do gardening, so that everyone feels that it is also his responsibility to maintain the greenery of this hospital.'],

Our patients can take an evening stroll while enjoying the scenery of the calming water, the floating wetlands and the greenery around the pond. In a way, we have managed to motivate the patients to leave their beds and come out of the wards.

                    ['CHONG YEAN', 'When we started in 2000, it was just an idea of getting the architects and the planners to comb through Singapore, to find places of unique identity and interesting character, that we can build on and make something more out of them. As we went through all the major roads that branch off from the city centre, we found that it was quite difficult to conceive the identity along Telok Blangah Road. At that time Mrs. Koh-Lim Wen Gin was the Chief Planner. She had us step back and look at it, which was when it hit us: "Hey, we have these series of nice huge parks that are already forming the character for this area!" But over the years, we had lost sight of these hill parks, because they were individual parks each with its own programme, despite sharing the same geography, the same flora and fauna, and the same history. They were divided by main roads like Henderson Road and Alexandra Road, and in the middle, there was a nursery that separated them from Kent Ridge. So, the idea sprung up: What if we can connect the hill parks together? But how do we do it? That’s when we came up with the idea of a high-level link, and of opening up part of the nursery to the public. In the end, it connects them to form this nine-kilometre route all the way to Clementi Woods. We also decided to hold a design competition, to invite architects to submit their ideas in response to this unique opportunity. So, what drove you to participate in the competition?'],
                    ['LAWRENCE', 'It started off with the desire to do something for Singapore. Back then I was still in London, I had just graduated from school and had this idea of creating something special for the people. So, when this competition came along, my tutor from the AA and founder of IJP, George L. Legendre, and I decided to give it a try and see whether we can make something different.'],

                    ['LAWRENCE', 'Yes, the whole idea is to create a sense of surprise, a sense of place. As the bridge is curved, when people walk along the bridge, they see a different part of the city every moment, at every point. On the convex side, it reaches out to the sea on the south, whereas on the concave side, it embraces the city, so that as you walk, you see the city skyline – the old Housing Development Board flats, the port, the Central Business District, and all these happen in the midst of a natural environment on these southern ridges. This is the kind of experience that we wanted to create for the people when they walk along this bridge. It’s a constantly changing experience, that shifts with the time of the day and also the time of the year. Shadows and light play a lot in this design as well. It’s also amazing that the bridge connects the ecology of both sides, and that allows not just people, but animals, and other life forms to go through.'],

                    ['LAWRENCE', 'It looks complicated, but actually it is just a simple trigonometric equation. The whole process of mathematical design was intended to simplify the form and the structure. Because, first of all, we wanted to create a natural form that simulates the undulating and natural terrain of the Southern region. We were researching on parametric surfaces then, so we thought it was quite appropriate to apply this design methodology, and - at the same time - create something that was natural and yet beautiful.'],

                    ['LAWRENCE', 'Yes, but I think it is the constraints that make the project better. They presented us with a set of parameters that we had to work with. In fact, using parametric designs helped to ensure the accuracy of the design. Knowing that we had to raise twenty metres from one end to the other across a length of two hundred and eighty metres, we were able to bend and raise the structure precisely so that the landing points meet perfectly on site, in spite of the natural terrain.'],
                    ['CHONG YEAN', 'Yes, thank you for the curve that goes up and down, so it has this alcove that we can now sit very comfortably. I’m sure you faced challenges in trying to create seats that peel off as the floor goes down. Was that intentional or was this the result of parametric design?'],
                    ['LAWRENCE', 'In a way it was intentional. First of all, the steel structure that curves up and down is actually a part of the structural design requirements. It’s simply an arch like a typical arch bridge. The downwards wave is actually a continuing structure supported at the points of inflection where the columns are. So, for a long walk along the bridge, we thought it would be nice to provide sitting and resting areas, because we wanted to design a more community-centric and inclusive project for the people. We tried to imagine the elderly walking this entire bridge, and they would definitely need some resting spots. We also thought about people in wheelchairs, children in strollers, how they could ascend the bridge from one end to the other. When we design for people, we need to think about their needs, their preferences, and how they would use the bridge.'],

After it was opened, my colleague told me that he came here about one in the morning, and he saw some people lying here looking at the stars, and some people playing the guitar serenading their friends. I was very impressed that it has turned into a nice public space.'],

In the morning, you have the commuters and exercise groups. So, it’s really a place for everyone. In fact, it has become a popular spot for wedding photography as well! I think that, sometimes, architecture and design can really create memories for people, memories in the city. As architects, I think this is what we try to do. We are not just designing something that looks good or stylistic, but we want to create something that is actually useful for the people, so that they can enjoy it and create memories with their loved ones. I think that’s the ultimate goal of architecture.'],

                    ['BOON GEE', 'What was interesting about the Forest Walk design was that the idea wasn’t conceived at the office. It was a weekend during the competition period, we were out for a family gathering at an National Parks Board (NParks) event in Sungei Buloh. There was an interesting performance in, which the performers were using some plants to do a dance. It was the ‘mile-a-minute’ plants, a type of creeper. So we thought perhaps we could draw inspiration from nature, metaphorically speaking, to come up with a design where visitors could have some sort of relationship with the nature. In this way, we see our architecture very much like an organic plant, like this ‘mile-a-minute’ plant, a fast-growing creeper, which could easily attach itself to the the natural topography. Its triangular leaves were how we derived the triangular modular system.'],
                    ['CHONG YEAN', 'That’s a very interesting story behind the triangular modular system. I think the next time when I walk along here, I would be imagining that I’m actually slowly following the creepers as I climb up the hills.'],
                    ['BOON GEE', 'The triangular module actually helped a lot in the prefabrication and construction. At that time, we were keen to explore the idea of a kit of parts, how things could be modularised, and the idea of prefabrication using customised components. The triangular module could be adapted to different kinds of terrain and avoid certain areas. By using prefabricated components, it becomes a highly adaptable system. This works very well with our idea of working with nature, and allowing nature to become part of the whole experience, rather than working against nature.'],
                    ['CHONG YEAN', 'Yes, I remember in your submission, you used the word ‘stitch’, as in using your structure to stitch nature together like a fabric, to create a new kind of public space for people.'],

Had we designed a long and huge mega-structure, I think it would not be what we are seeing and enjoying today. It would have destroyed the hilly parts a lot more. We also understood that we had to confine ourselves to two-metre working zone on both sides, so minimising the felling of beautiful, mature trees. As a result, the walkway actually meanders a lot more at certain sections, rather than simply cutting through the site. The constraints taught us to give more respect to nature.'],

At the same time, we also saw that the other side was a lot more urbanised. Thus, we wanted to create a bridge that acted as a transition between the two areas. The curvature of the bridge is quite complex: not only is it curved on plan, its curved form is also tilted.'],

I came here with my family, and it struck me then that I was no longer the architect, but part of the larger crowd of people. I saw people in wheelchairs and children in strollers. And to me, that was the moment of realisation, that making this elevated walkway accessible and user-friendly means so much to the people. At the end of the day, the importance of the project is not about overcoming technical challenges, but ensuring that people get to enjoy these spaces, be close to nature, and be surrounded by all these greenery.

They offer us excellent sites for the artworks. But what was very interesting is the process of finding the ideal places to site different artworks, and this was when we realised that there were actually small pockets of spaces that could complement certain artworks. When the visitors walk around the bay, and when they take a certain turn of the corner, they could possibly discover an artwork there. I think that adds to the delight for our visitors.'],

Certain sites could just be a thin streak of landscape where you’d find a blinking eye looking at you. We activated these so-called under-utilised spaces. It’s not just about siting the artwork that speaks for itself, but it’s how you relate to the public infrastructure like a bench, a tree, the building next to it, in order to have that segments. I think this is what a site-specific work tends to do, casting a new eye to look at a space and saying, “Hey, this artwork has given a new perspective of this scene, that you have never seen before!”'],
                    ['JASON', 'Indeed. Through multiple editions, we also realised that while the exhibition of light art installations was important, we could layer it with other activities that complement the exhibition and this would help the community to better relate it with a festival. Thus, in the past few years, we have introduced many different events, through partnership with various corporate partners. This year, for example, we have the carnival. It’s great for family entertainment, besides looking at the art installations.'],

This is something we treasure, as the free space we now enjoy is very much a planned one. The fact that we have free space is a result of careful considerations in planning all other spaces. It took 50 years to plan the Marina Bay area, which has become the beautiful promenade that we can now enjoy. I think this is a very compelling narrative.'],

                    ['JASON', 'The process also calls for extensive discussion with artists, on how and where to site the artworks. I think this is a very important aspect of the organiser’s work. As the presenter and curator for the festival, we are responsible for consulting the artists and getting their inputs. Sometimes, we may have an initial thought about where to place a certain artwork, but after discussion with the artists, we may realise that there is actually a better location. So this is really about finding out about how public spaces can be better utilised to present the artworks. This is important, because very often we forget that public spaces are intended for the public, and if we are able to optimise what the site has to offer, visitors will appreciate these spaces in a much deeper way.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority is the national land use planning authority advocating sustainable development, especially in the physical development of Marina Bay. Therefore, we positioned the festival as Asia’s leading sustainable light art festival. We were often asked the question, “As a light art festival that consumes energy, how is it possible for it to be a sustainable event or even advocate sustainability?” We have developed a few ways to achieve that. One way is to encourage the artist to use energy efficient lighting and recycled or up-cycled materials. We also actively reach out to the general public to reinforce this message. Another approach is that we have a campaign called “Switch Off, Turn Up”, where we work with our partners, many of them owners of buildings and properties around Marina Bay and beyond, to turn off the non-essential lighting and turn up the temperature of the air conditioning during the three-week festival. In this way, we can try to achieve savings from the energy consumption. What is very heartening is that they continue to practise this beyond the festival. We did some energy usage audits, and ascertained there were significant net savings in the energy consumed.'],

At that moment, the interpretation of what a light festival should be kind of took a very interesting turn. Lighting itself is never sustainable in that sense, so I think what that particular festival has brought up about sustainable solutions is a very interesting proposition.

I think having next year’s edition in the Civic District, to include Fort Canning and some historical heritage sites, where Raffles set foot before, will make an interesting narrative.

Thus, the idea of a schoolhouse and a schoolyard worked really well! I remember saying, "The office has to be a command centre, and then everything else evolves around it, as we need to know what\'s going on." In the end, the schoolhouse actually became the office, and the schoolyard became all the “classrooms”. The pillars became trees, with canopies hovering over the space. Then, we decided how we could organise that space within each classroom, such that it could still function as a class, but at the same time keep the overall concept of an open schoolyard. We wanted to keep the openness of the space, because we value community – building relationships and building community.'],
                    ['SHING', 'When we first came to see the space, it was very stark, a little dismaying. The question was then how could we scale it for the kids? Since we decided to go with the idea of the school administrative office being a command centre, to see all the kids from any direction, we then found a way to scale down and to tame this office space with really, really high ceilings and windows, which were so alien to a child. We employed iconography: the iconic gable house shape, the iconic tree branch shape. These are a little cartoonish on purpose, because we felt that it is important that the children learn to visualise and come up with a sensory mental image from the suggestion of a word. Thus these considerations and ideas guided the overall framework of the design. What we love about the Cove is also this belief that people from all ages, even very young children, should be treated with respect, dignity, and trust that they can take care of themselves. Treat them now in a way that you want them to treat others later on. So even though they are really young, we believe that the open plan design is okay, and that they are not going to just run crazy or run into someone else\'s classroom, or yell at the top of their voices and not think about other people. This kind of teaching about respecting others works in your school, I think, because you believe strongly in it, and you\'re able to enforce it in the way the school is run, which then allowed us to build something like this. In many other schools, there is a fear of children getting distracted, for example, by what is happening outside the classroom, so clients’ preferences often meant us ending up having to break everything up into little spaces.'],

The idea is that, children, and generally humans are like animals; we need to have a safe prospect of what we are going into. So, it’s just like with these corrugated edges: if we can sit with our backs protected and look at where we\'re about to go, then we will make a decision to go for it. We employed this strategy in the design of the nooks, which are these little spaces carved out from the edges of the room or the classroom, scaled for one, two, or more than two kids. So, the kids can sit there, make a decision by themselves, and go for it. And when they do, they are fully engaged in all their senses. In terms of creating wonder and delight, a lot of these were very simple. It was about turning to things like natural materials as much as possible, and not giving them too much information.'],
                    ['GERALDINE', 'Yes, like the shelf that you built, what we call a three-in-one shelf. Because space is a premium, we wanted to go beyond just being functional and to create a sense of wonder and delight. So, we were thinking hard about what we could do with four of these shelves that had big spaces. One day, I came into the 5-year-olds’ classroom and I asked the children, "What are you doing?" They said to me, "We\'re building a bus!" As an educator, I was thinking about boxes. And I did see the boxes, but I did not see what the children saw in their imagination - they had integrated the boxes with the shelf to make their bus! And that really surprised and delighted me!'],
                    ['SHING', 'We really tried to support that with the environment. Even something as simple as the view. They have those mounds, those nooks, and the periscope, from which they can say, "Hey, I can look outside of the school right now. I can look at what\'s around me." They can do that, and they don\'t need to ask an adult for help or lift them up. They can, at any time, have control over their own environment and experience, which is very critical to being able to engage all their senses and their imagination.'],

It makes them very happy to come to school, because they don\'t have this design of a periscope, or a mound that they can look out of at home. We did an interesting project with the 6-year-olds, and they were guessing what is going on in the class, all excitedly going, "I think it\'s gonna be this"... The whole anticipation of just looking out, trying to figure out what\'s going to happen, and then bringing it back into the classroom, having a segments, learning about hypotheses and plot, writing a story about it... and all because the design of the enabled this to happen!'],

Because their classrooms are just rooms, they are often curious about how we can teach with our open plan concept. When they walked into Caterpillar’s Cove, the common question asked is invariably, "How does learning really happen?" They could see that the children were very focused and very attentive to what was going on in that space with the teacher, or in small groups as they were working together. These come from the idea of self-regulation. If you look at how the world is moving, we go to offices with ‘hot desks’ now, and we need to learn how to work with the noise and the distractions. So, if you can try to do that early in life, then the children are much more prepared later on.'],
                    ['SHING', 'Yes, but that\'s a risk, right? Yet, you were willing to take this risk. That was also one of the joys for us working together. You were willing to take certain risks, and said that you also had a duty in your role to educate parents, to look at things from a different point of view. That was refreshing for us, because most early childhood clients that we had or have had since then, were really afraid of taking risks. Everything needs to be super rounded, everywhere needs to have no steps, because a child might get a cut or fall. But then, what happens once they leave the school, they\'re going to fall, because they don\'t know how to deal with a step! I remember having this segments with you several times, and you just said, "Well, we just have to educate the parents. We have to understand that this is the real world." Of course, we don\'t put blades or sharp things all over the place, but the kids need to learn that the corner is sharp and they need to be very careful about negotiating it, and they need to be able to get on a step and get down without necessarily falling all the time.'],
                    ['GERALDINE', 'Exactly! We need to educate the parents and the children about what is a risk and what is a hazard. A risk is something you can see. Our outdoor space is without EPDM rubber flooring (I wanted to move away from that), which actually helps them to understand that this space is not meant for high jumping and rigorous running, since the GFA just doesn\'t allow for such activities, but it allows you to skip, to hop, and maybe to ride on a tricycle. We have beautiful footage of our infants learning how to negotiate the not-so-safe steps. It\'s gravel, and they knew what to do. Parents who watched it were simply amazed.'],

Having been a teacher for a long time, I understand the frustration of the young children not able to see you, when you’re telling a story, because there\'s a big book between you and twenty kids on the floor. Currently, I am also a faculty member teaching in the Institute of Higher Learning (IHL), often at an auditorium that is tiered. So, we wondered, “Could we bring that idea into an early childhood space? And we were amazed, when you designed the mound. It was so simple!'],
                    ['SHING', 'What I love about this project is that we never know what the kids are going to do. They always surprise us. For example, when we designed the mounds, the goal was to create an amphitheatre kind of seating for kids. But when we were doing a video of a teacher reading to them, some of the kids were just lying on it horizontally; some were lying on it upside- down with the legs on the top; and some were just sort of draped over. They just didn\'t want to sit still. It was so wonderful, because the teacher allowed them to be in any position they wanted to, and because of that, they were able to sit through the whole story and not get up and walk around. We also believe that children shouldn\'t be sitting in a chair all day long. It was a wonderful thing to watch and learn from children, because the way they inhabit things is so natural – it doesn\'t get filtered. We can start to think about furniture in a much more ergonomically appropriate way for them.  '],

We thought, “Hey, why not have a space that is beautiful, aesthetically inspiring, a community space that is different? A place that is a refuge for learning and inspiration? A space where you can access books and magazines as well.” The design brief was “design is for everyone”, which speaks of our passion in bringing design to the community and making it something that they can internalise, enjoy and appreciate the difference it makes to the learning and reading experience.'],
                    ['GARETH', 'Singapore Polytechnic has always been advocating design thinking. Coming into the project, we had large shoes to fill, because when this library was formerly at Ngee Ann City above Kinokuniya, it was the quintessential library, loved by everyone, and there was a public outcry when it was closed. When it was announced that we were going to do a Library @ Orchard to replace the one that had been at Ngee Ann City, I knew there were very high expectations to meet, with everyone asking “Are we going to get a library as nice as the old one?” And because libraries are for the community, I remember you wanted to engage the community in the very design of the library.'],

And how do you get the community involved in the whole process, so that when the product is unveiled, they feel that this is something that they really enjoy and that they want to keep coming to? I think that was really exciting for us. Everybody who worked on this project loves books and cares about libraries very much, from the students that worked with us to the architectural consultants. And you were one of the students, who helped us in the early design thinking process, right?'],
                    ['JAWARA', 'Yes, Gareth approached me, because I wanted to do this library project with him. What we did was to engage the public, talking to people to learn what they wanted for the future library. We could certainly feel the enthusiasm during the interview process. We held interviews around 7:30 pm on Mondays or Tuesdays and people would come in after work to talk with us until quite late in the evening – to share their experiences and what they would need in the library.'],
                    ['ELAINE', 'At that time, we had the idea of bringing design to everyone. A library is a place where you can bring an idea to many members of the community, and we were thinking about how to do that. When you work with partners, the sum is always greater than the parts. Your team at Singapore Polytechnic with your passion for design and design thinking, were absolutely the right partners.'],
                    ['GARETH', 'A library is all about books and texts, and we used their subjects to inform our design. For example, the labels of the spaces like ‘make’, ‘imagine’ were all celebrated in the design through strong type elements. We also respected what was required in the design of a library. For example, we responded to the acoustic requirements with a terrain-like form that we flipped into the ceiling. It creates a sense of journey from the entrance, all the way to the end, where you reach the books. Another insight we gleaned from the users was that, in this day and age, where the process of creation has been democratised, people are interested in creating content, and not just in consuming it. That’s what gave birth to all these spaces: the maker space, the programme zones, where people could come in and engage the community and start to create content themselves.'],
                    ['ELAINE', 'The whole design thinking process and journey that we had with citizens, librarians, the Singapore Polytechnic students and the architectural consultants gave us a library that had many firsts like the acoustic ceiling which, besides being beautiful, served the purpose of keeping the space quiet and private. It was also the first library to have a beautiful magazine wall, which we’ve replicated in many other libraries. The fact that we had flexible programming spaces, gave us the opportunity to have intimate as well as large scale programmes. All of these brought a lot of benefits to library-goers, who found they had a lot of variety and were inspired to read when they came here. The design of the display, the bookshelves with that little curve – all helped to enhance the sense of discovery. When library patrons want to read, there’s a cocoon for them to hide away in or if they want to sit with friends, they have the curved community tables. It has been a wonderful learning experience, not just for the users of the library, but for our own librarians and library planners as well.'],

We must also give credit to the team and all the members of the firm, who spent a lot of time crafting the project. Details are important, and they really spent a lot of effort creating them.

We half expected everyone to have moved on to e-books, but we were surprised to find from the interviews that many people still appreciate the physical book: its colours, the sensorial experience of flipping through the pages and the smell of it. That physical enjoyment of a book is really still out there in the community. This is wonderful and I’m glad we have a space that celebrates that.

We’ve had people gathering in one place, moving on to another and then having little discussions. We’ve built quiet spaces as well as community learning circles in a public space, and I think that reflects the library’s mission as a social touchpoint. We’ve had lots of users say wonderful things about this library and I think we achieved what we set out to do – to convey that design is for everyone and that it should make everyone feel at home.'],

That’s usually the elderly’s form of greeting, and we thought there is no better way than to bond everyone through food. We do realise that a lot of the elderly love cooking and can cook very well, even if they may have lost some of their skills.

This, in principle, is really an antithesis to the conventional activity centres or void-deck centres in Singapore, which are typically quite enclosed and caged up. For GoodLife! Makan, the idea of openness is extremely important, especially for the nature of our programmes and the user group. Instead of walls, we designed a whole series of doors which are always open to welcome people. This translates to the powerful message of inviting the community to be a part of it. We also utilise colours and graphics, which are in line with GoodLife’s motto: Ageing is about vibrancy. Just like Aunty Ruby says, it’s about being happy, and that translates to the usage of an array of colours. The colours are also functional in that they are used for zoning purposes, so that the users can identify the different areas, such as for cooking or for gathering. We also use signages that are universal to overcome language barriers, hence promoting inclusivity.'],

I recall there was a talk by the Health Promotion Board, and there were a lot of curious passers-by who were looking in, and we had to inform the speaker that there might be more people coming in. True enough, people who came in for other activities saw the talk going on and they joined in as well, which made us very happy.'],

Hence, we adopted the idea and wanted to have activities in the open, so that seniors will be happy to join in instead of feeling hesitant. As Chee Huang mentioned, it’s not a common sight to have such an open space due to security reasons. The goal here is to attract especially the stay-alone and isolated elderly, who are vulnerable and at risk of social isolation. We really want to get them to come down here, form new friendships and re-discover their potential, instead of just staying at home and waiting for food delivery, because they may lose their capacity to do certain things. We want them to come here to be independent. We will try our best to help and facilitate as much as we can with things that they can do.'],

Aside from integrating green features in the new housing we build, we also take steps to improve the sustainability of existing buildings through interventions to help save energy, conserve water and strengthen community bonding etc. HDB introduced the Greenprint Fund to encourage and support ideas from residents that help to make the built environment more liveable. This ‘Community Parklet’ is one such idea that came from the community, which was meant to improve the ground floor of a HDB residential block, what is commonly called a void deck – a space that is left open and vacant to allow for flexible use. The Community Parklet introduced greenery and other features, to make the space more convivial as a community gathering space.'],

We, therefore, brought in the architects and engineers from HDB, together with whom we held workshops for the residents, to find out what they wanted in the space, right down to the details of the lighting and ventilation. The building professionals then built on that to arrive at a plan in consultation with the community, which eventually became the place as you see it now.'],

This is a homely space where people living nearby can come to be seen and heard, and engage each other in conversation. We also did a study that built on this idea in collaboration with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The researchers from Social Urban Research Groupe (SURGe) suggested we set up a ‘Smart Void Deck’ – an ‘adaptive space’ with moveable furniture and adjustable lighting that could be set by residents to a configuration that suited them best, depending on whether they wanted to use the space for studying or dining and so on. Sensors were installed to record data of the changes made by residents. This data could then be analysed to understand what are the most often used, and therefore, the most preferred configurations that could inform the design of other void deck spaces. The intention of the study is to derive learning points that can be introduced on a large scale to other housing blocks.'],

It was, therefore, important to use materials which could withstand the weather and were fireproof. We also had to choose plants that would grow in the shade and did not require much maintenance other than simple watering, which could be taken care of by the residents. After setting up the place, maintenance is key to its sustainability. We were happy that the residents here took ownership of the space and keep it from being damaged or vandalised. It is well taken care of and therefore is comfortable to spend time in.'],

We try to keep things simple, so that such interventions effortlessly integrate with the lifestyles of the residents. For a neighbourhood like Yuhua, which has a large population of elderly residents, introducing something that requires using a lot of technology may not work well. It is important that residents begin to personalise the space and give the place an identity. It is more meaningful to allow them to shape the place themselves.'],

                    ['IAN', 'This was the second phase of a research project that the HDB initiated in 2013 to understand how the built environment impacts community bonding. The aim was to establish whether the many common spaces provided in Housing & Development Board housing estates are indeed effective in promoting ties within the community. The study found that while the spaces are well used, interactions among neighbours tend to be minimal. Hence, we can make active interventions to facilitate bonding between the residents This part of the research focused on testing out such interventions and one of them was what we called the ‘Social Linkway’ design typology, which is a covered walkway that runs through the housing estate. While walkways are usually high traffic paths, people may not stop to spend time at these spaces. This provided an opportunity to test if introducing social functions along the linkways would encourage greater community interactions.'],

                    ['IAN', 'HDB did not want to implement the project on its own. To encourage community ownership, we involved the residents in deciding the design of the spaces as well as the activities that could be included in it. If you look at it today, people have made these spaces their own, they feel like its theirs and this is one important thing we were trying to achieve. The way this project progressed is that we shortlisted a few sites in this area and reached out to people like Mdm. Chong who is the chairperson of the Residents’ Committee in this neighbourhood, to understand which of these sites are the most suitable to enhance and develop into activity nodes. We then held ideation workshops with the residents, where the idea of a cafe corner, library and study space for children was shortlisted by the community. That led to the creation of the community cafe corner and library you see today. The enhancement of this space also serves to build visibility for the Residents’ Committee here and get more people involved in community activities. For example, when residents come to the cafe, they would also get to know more about the community activities organised by the Residents’ Committees (RCs) and possibly be interested in joining in.'],
                    ['MDM. CHONG', 'Food is a popular interest. There are volunteers who cook a little food for the café. Besides this, the residents themselves bring down food, to share with others. This happens a lot during festivals like Chinese New Year, when they have more cookies than they can eat themselves! We also recently started a toy library for the kids living around to come and play with instead of owning a lot of toys that take up space at home. Then in the afternoon, we also have students using this space to study with their friends.'],
                    ['IAN', 'That is an important point; though the café serves free coffee, it is primarily the community that comes in to provide the food that attracts other people and enables them to make new friends. These acts of contribution and sharing really bring out a positive spirit of community through which people get to know one another better. There are other neighbourhood organisations which work with Mdm. Chong to bring programmes such as free haircut, furniture exchange, rummy-O competition to the community through this space. They don’t have to put in as much effort as they did before to reach out to the residents because the well- equipped space is now a natural crowd puller.'],

                    ['IAN', 'When people started to gather here, they wanted to improve the space surrounding the café as well. Residents realised that they have a common interest in gardening and decided to build a community garden beside the cafe, along the social linkway, from scratch. It took two years from start to finish, because there were a lot of discussions among the residents and hardwork involved in converting the turfed area into a thriving garden today.'],
                    ['MDM. CHONG', 'In the initial stages, the residents noticed that the plants weren’t doing very well and they realised that the soil was unsuitable for gardening. So, they took ownership and worked to change the soil and dig up debris to make it more conducive for growing plants.  One consequence of having an open-concept garden is that the plants might be taken away by some without permission. However, we believe that over time, as people realised the hard work put into the garden, the negative behaviour would stop and more residents would join in to take care and sustain the garden.'],
                    ['IAN', 'We have to look at what benefits the majority. The ones who pluck the plants are few compared to the many who enjoy the openness of the garden. If we were to build a fence to protect the plants, we would defeat the purpose of having a community garden; meant for all to enjoy and to provide a platform for greater interactions. If we continue to keep the space free to enter and use regardless of a few incidents of misuse, we hope that people will eventually learn to respect the garden and end up treating all public spaces better than they did before. Grassroots leaders like Mdm Chong play a very important role in the community. They guide people who are interested to contribute to the community on the ‘know-hows’.'],
                    ['MDM. CHONG', 'For example, when residents mentioned they were interested in gardening, we helped them to approach the relevant government agencies to understand how to go about setting up the community garden.'],
                    ['IAN', 'To keep an initiative like this going, it is important to have a group of people and not just one person running it. Community gardens elsewhere in Singapore that were looked after by a single person has higher risk of falling into neglect in the absence of their caretakers. That is why Mdm. Chong encourages a group of people to tend to the garden together. Anyone else who is interested in gardening is welcome to join the group. '],
