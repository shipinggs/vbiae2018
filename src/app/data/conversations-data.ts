                    ["Arvind", "We have been living in this house for five years now, and I have to say, this place is just right for us. As a small family of three, we live in the main compound of the house. Our guests, when we have them, can stay at the rear part of the house. The wonderful part is the small communal space in between the two parts of the house, where we can sit around, have coffee, and meet our friends. We also love the high ceiling of this house – it just gives so much breathing space."],
                    ["Yong Ter", "This house has a long and narrow space, so my then client wanted it to look and feel spacious as much as possible. The original configuration was very different - the shophouse used to stop half-way here. But since the client also bought over the rear property, we had the opportunity to create another courtyard. This was how this garden space came about, and we created this big communal space which houses the kitchen and dining area. For the rear extension, we set off from the boundary, such that you can have immediate access to the greenery and outdoor space, when you are in any of the cubicles. You are sheltered, but at the same time you feel like being outdoors. One of the other challenges was to retain a sense of history, heritage and tradition and yet, be compatible with contemporary living. This process was pretty interesting, because we had relatively more time to ponder, as the construction went on. While we were trying to improve the wall, we realised that its plastering has to be removed in order to create a new one. But the old brick walls were so charming, so why not just expose all the brick walls? We also learnt that this shophouse had gone through a series of renovations. Our curiosity was piqued and we had the ambition then to trace back to the very origin of this shophouse and we found that it used to be a tiny bookshop selling cassette tapes and magazines. As the building is 100 years old, we peeled off layers of paint at the front façade to reveal the original colour. To our surprise, there were actually only a few shades of colours, which look almost like a watercolour rendering. We also kept the old signage, because the neighbours here, as well as my client, used to patronise this bookshop in their childhood. On the second storey, we intentionally kept those cavities, so that it gives one a hint of what this space used to be – a storage space for the bookstore. We also kept some of the old boundary walls untouched, which provided hints of where the old boundary line used to be."],

And when you close the door, you simply forget how big the house can be. It is very unique how you use this land. Others would probably build something that is not so open, because of the way this site has been tucked in."],

People just spread naturally to the rear of this house and moved around nicely. Yet, we still had our privacy because nobody went upstairs or went too far behind."],

And we thought that aesthetically this is rather nice, this minimalist style of living. Being an Indian and coming from an Indian family, this house requires us to have a bit of a mindshift towards living minimally. For example, traditionally, our kitchens are always closed and as an enclave, thus it was a mindshift for us to learn how to use an open kitchen here."],

Once we moved into this house, we realised that a house can actually give energy back. Sometimes when I come back after work, I walk in the house, look at the entire aesthetic of the house, and I feel rejuvenated. I feel humble and great at the same time. I think it has a lot to do with the material you use, it blending with the earth, the natural things. It’s all very raw, but yet very quirky."],
                    ["Yong Ter", "I’m really glad to hear that. That was the real intention behind the design – to create the kind of energy that money can’t buy. The design has achieved its goal, if it resonates well with the users. It’s also about how a place could bring people together to connect with each other and with the environment better. I believe that the materials themselves have energy. That’s why I’m more inclined to use raw materials, because I feel that they are still alive, and they are creating the energy that resonates with the user, as compared to using processed materials."],
                    ["Arvind", "Yes, that’s what we like. We could get a house with very shiny marble and granite, but we feel that it might not connect. Here, we walk barefoot in the house, and we can feel the energy flowing back to us. In terms of housing in Singapore, most developers just want to maximise space. They want to make use of every square inch to give extra room and extra space, build a pool, build a tennis court, build everything. But I think they forget about the bonding between people. People also need brighter light and more sunlight. We have seen some big houses, where the land on which the houses were built on, was cut into two. It feels like you’re just living separately from each other rather than with each other. But with this house, it doesn’t feel that way."],

They think that I am crazy for keepingthe floor area small, and for having so many planting areas. Some even say I am living under an overhead bridge! But this place is like alittle experiment to me. It started with a simple design brief I gave Ling Hao eight years ago: to house three guys – my father, my brother andI. Basically, I asked for three separate spaces for three guys and some areas for planting.The brief was to keep it simple and easy to maintain, nothing too complicated."],
                    ["Ling Hao", "Given the slim budget, we try to keep the things here rather slim – we kept whatever we could. So, that wall is an old wall, on top of which we built the new wall after inserting a steel structure. The slab is only 150mm thick, but within that there is a steel beam of 125mm, the slimmest possible in Singapore, so that the new additions were in harmony with the old structure. The built-up area of the house is about 1,500 square feet (or 140 square metres) which is about the size of an apartment, but there is a richness to the house despite itssize. Because certain parts of the house have more than one function, like the kitchen is a pathway as well as the entrance. These ‘paths’ add to the richness of the house. To experience this house is to be in the different parts ofthe house, to walk the house, to feel it. I think this is how houses can be more. Our present experience is often shaped by our experiences, when we were young. I spent my youth living in a very open kind of space. So, even when it’sa room, there is this idea of open living. I think it has become a kind of ambition I have now, when I am creating spaces."],
                    ["Yung Ming", "As our family grew from three to six people, we could still manage. This houseis very open, so for privacy, we needed to learn how to share common spaces and communicate better. Although we have our respective rooms in the house, the central space is where we meet. Sometimes, everyone fights for the TVin the middle, so we have to compromise - by having TVs in our own rooms. Sometimes, when we come back late, we have to remind ourselves not to make too much noise. So, there is both good and bad to living in our shared space. You can shout across the room to send a message, but the downside is once everyone starts shouting, no one would be able to sleep. There is some fun to it, when you embrace that openness."],

You will have a kind of glow from sweating and youwill look so much better. You also have to wear certain clothes that are more comfortable for this weather. Many parts of this house are naturally ventilated. Besides the walls, the rest of the surfaces are openings, which are quite large. For example, there are no walls abovethe entrance, just metal grille. The back of the house, near the kitchen, can also be completely open. So, you can feel it when there is a breeze, like right now. And that I think is nice because besides the experience of the house, you will have the memory of the wind. So, the openness is what allows this to happen."],

This is because we have kept the finishes the same for the whole house, whether it is inside or outside. For example,the doors are all metal doors, whether inside or outside. You can just move around and through the house seamlessly. The space is a double volume space and when the light streams in from the two skylights at the side, the space is almost as airy and bright as the outside. Then, you hear the birds chirping, you see the plants growing at the side, and you feel like you are still outside."],
                    ["Yung Ming", "What I have learnt from this place is how the indoor and outdoor experience can blend together. You can live in an open space, inside, yet you can experience some of the outdoor kind of sounds and experience. So it is kind of unique. Most people who visit this place can sense the blurring between the indoorsand outdoors. It is quite obvious if you are in this space. Because of that, the spaces in this house are very dynamic. At different times of the day, you can have different favourite spots in the house. My family members have their own favourite spots. My wife loves sitting up on the roof to read, in the late evenings or early mornings. In the morning, it is also nice to bein this central space, because the light comes in and you can hear the birds. It is a nice place for breakfast, or just to see the light comeup from above. Sometimes, when a cloud passes, the space becomes darker suddenly and you are struck by an awareness of your surroundings. The skylight can even be opened to allow the rain in, but that is not encouraged. In the evening, it is nice to be up on the roof, maybe around past 6.30 or 7pm, when it is cooler. You can gaze at the trees behind, look towards the forest of the nature reserve or watch a really beautiful sunset."],
                    ["Ling Hao", "For me, I am always interested in how this house is lived in. The making of the house is a process, but the story is part of a bigger thing. It is part of someone’s life, part of the overall work or something. What is also nice is how the house is transformed, to become this garden or this place where we live, and where nature becomes part of the house, part of the everyday."]

And as you come into this space, which is the heart of the house where the whole family can come together, there is another garden. As you go to the backof the house, where you can find the other bedroom, there are more spaces for planting too. Finally, as you go up to the roof, it is also a bigger space where you can work on planting. I think what is special is the way that Yung Ming embraced this idea of planting. He has been planting in the house. And to plant means to let things grow and to live with the growing, so you realise that you are not living in a fixed world."],

If the hair is too long, you have to trim it. Contrary to popular belief, I think that plants are easier to maintain. You can buy expensive things like paintingand sculptures, but it is actually easier to maintain something simpler and less shiny. Plants also give a different life compared to hard, expensive sculptures, which are beautiful of course, but growing your own little things and watching them grow, there is something magical about it. It is about evolving with time. That’s why this house has different phasesover the years. If you look at its old photos over time, it has continuously evolved and changed. It has been a very fulfilling experience to live here. I think our place in nature should be next to plants."],

It is not so controlled, which to me, is something special. Our climate offersa beautiful, shady environment that is cool.It is actually what we build that makes the environment harsh. The city is harsh because of our ambitions versus the possible conditions of this climate. I am interested in the possibility of what can happen, if we step back a bit."],
                    ["Yung Ming", "If you have that kind of formal planting, where you want to control that lookall the time, it becomes hard to maintain. You need a lot of pruning, fertilising, and controlling of the elements. But if you relax, let the plants grow, keep the weeds that are strong and beautiful and maybe let the plants that you originally select, which are not very strong and hard to maintain, die... basically, let nature take over and you will have a kind of balance which I find is better. But not everyone can accept such things like weeds and wild trees. A lot of people are scared that they cannot control nature, or rather, they just want to control nature. You can see it from the way they live, the way they build their house, and the way their garden is. You can see how much control they want, how much they are afraid of letting go. It is hard for them to let nature be and accept that nature will do some things that you cannot control so well.    "],

Therefore, family and community were the main design impetus in this project driving our inputs and design concepts. This project is one of the few, where we have given the architect leeway in expressing how the programming will be realised. We wanted to see how we can reinvent public housing in a new, modern way, that is centred around the community and the people."],
                    ["Sod", "That’s right, the real challenge for us was to see how multi-generational housing can be designed. What makes this different from other projects is that this entails taking social and political agendas, and turning them into architecture. For me, the process began by thinking of housing as individual modules and then turning that into a flexible entity to combine elderly studio units with the other duplexes. With the modular system in mind, we were able to express the programme in the way that was reflected in the built form."],

There’s an interconnecting link at the top of the stairway with two doors facing each other and serving as a connecting route. When both residents want to interact, they may leave their doors open. When they don’t, the doors remain closed."],

Some of these families like to live close to one another, while some may say, “No, I don’t want to live too close to my parents, but maybe on a different floor.” Suddenly, architecture becomes the medium to provide people with a lot more choices on how they can pair their living spaces together."],

The first step was to see how we can re-interpret the centralised car park space. The car park space was designed as a long linear block, with the natural landscape tiered down to form the façade. This acts as a hillock, in other words, a small hill which acts as an effective bufferspace between the thresholds of the outside and the inside, the private and the public. A roof garden sits on the top of the car park space, functioning as a communal area that ties all the tower blocks together."],

HDB’s mission is notjust about building housing – we are equally interested in creating a whole environment for the residents and community of all generations, including the old, the young, and even non- residents within the locale. In Singapore, greenery has become a very important partof the living space. The unit itself is not just the only space that people enjoy. Instead of having a fenced-up development, this is about providing spaces of various attributes – small and intimate ones to larger public open spaces - for these diverse groups to enjoy. That is the true reflection of an effective public housing design!"],

What we have done in this project was to take this idea, rotate, express it in the longitudinal section and tease it apart for ventilation. We have therefore taken the idea of the precedent and adaptedit to our tropical climate. Sustainability was also a key design component in this project– the introduction of drip irrigation, solar panels to power the lighting in the common areas, bioswales and rainwater harvesting. As architects, we not only have a responsibility to the community, but also to the environment.

                    ["Arvind", "We have been living in this house for five years now, and I have to say, this place is just right for us. As a small family of three, we live in the main compound of the house. Our guests, when we have them, can stay at the rear part of the house. The wonderful part is the small communal space in between the two parts of the house, where we can sit around, have coffee, and meet our friends. We also love the high ceiling of this house – it just gives so much breathing space."],
                    ["Yong Ter", "This house has a long and narrow space, so my then client wanted it to look and feel spacious as much as possible. The original configuration was very different - the shophouse used to stop half-way here. But since the client also bought over the rear property, we had the opportunity to create another courtyard. This was how this garden space came about, and we created this big communal space which houses the kitchen and dining area. For the rear extension, we set off from the boundary, such that you can have immediate access to the greenery and outdoor space, when you are in any of the cubicles. You are sheltered, but at the same time you feel like being outdoors. One of the other challenges was to retain a sense of history, heritage and tradition and yet, be compatible with contemporary living. This process was pretty interesting, because we had relatively more time to ponder, as the construction went on. While we were trying to improve the wall, we realised that its plastering has to be removed in order to create a new one. But the old brick walls were so charming, so why not just expose all the brick walls? We also learnt that this shophouse had gone through a series of renovations. Our curiosity was piqued and we had the ambition then to trace back to the very origin of this shophouse and we found that it used to be a tiny bookshop selling cassette tapes and magazines. As the building is 100 years old, we peeled off layers of paint at the front façade to reveal the original colour. To our surprise, there were actually only a few shades of colours, which look almost like a watercolour rendering. We also kept the old signage, because the neighbours here, as well as my client, used to patronise this bookshop in their childhood. On the second storey, we intentionally kept those cavities, so that it gives one a hint of what this space used to be – a storage space for the bookstore. We also kept some of the old boundary walls untouched, which provided hints of where the old boundary line used to be."],

                    ["Arvind", "Changeability is what we also admire. When you open the door, you can experience how long the house is. And when you close the door, you simply forget how big the house can be. It is very unique how you use this land. Others would probably build something that is not so open, because of the way this site has been tucked in."],
                    ["Yong Ter", "We felt strongly about keeping this central space as open as possible, so that the neighbours on both sides of the house also have a view of this greenery. This is a shared backdrop for everybody in this area."],
                    ["Arvind", "It is especially pleasant in the evening. When we sit over here, the two fans are more than enough because of the high ceiling. And since it rains a lot here in Singapore, it’s nice to just sit and admire the rain outside... it’s like wow!"]

There was once when we threw a party for about 100 to 110 people in the garden space, and still, we did not feel that there were too many people in this tight space. People just spread naturally to the rear of this house and moved around nicely. Yet, we still had our privacy because nobody went upstairs or went too far behind."],

And we thought that aesthetically this is rather nice, this minimalist style of living. Being an Indian and coming from an Indian family, this house requires us to have a bit of a mindshift towards living minimally. For example, traditionally, our kitchens are always closed and as an enclave, thus it was a mindshift for us to learn how to use an open kitchen here."],
