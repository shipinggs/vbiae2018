        description: "The Pavilion’s centrepiece features a multi-sensory installation, a suspended transparent cloud made of handcrafted acrylic knots. The cloud is programmed to transmit light from above, shifting in colour and intensity to complement projected videos of Singapore’s built environment below. By trapping, bending and transmitting, the cloud creates an immersive environment and is a visual spectacle.\n\nComplete with lights, scent, sounds, and images of Singapore, the pavilion invites visitors to experience the spaces within the cloud and interact with the installation through a series of scented, translucent ceramic end-pieces that glow when they sense proximity.\n\nThe pavilion is an example of a resourceful, unexpected free space, designed to reach beyond physical constraints and instead, engage with the qualities of space-making that celebrate generosity and humanity through our senses.",
